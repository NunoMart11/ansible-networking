Networking Demos and Tests with Arista vEOS

Testing Ansible etc on a virtual vEOS instance of an Arista swtich. This is done on kvm.
Use the Arista-VEOS.xml and define it on kvm. You will need to download the Aboot iso and vEOS image from Arista as I cannot distribute that.
Place those images into your /var/lib/libvirt/images folder and correct the file versions in Arista-VEOS if needed.
